<p class="welcome">
  Welcome to Zach's nifty expense tracker. I've been doing something similar to this using spreadsheets and a lot of discipline. This is great for people who want to start a budget, but don't know how they currently spend their money.
</p>
<p class="welcome">
  This program is pretty simple to use. Just <a href="{% url 'login' %}">log in</a> (or <a href="{% url 'signup' %}">sign up</a> if you don't have an account yet). After logging in, I suggest recording a few of your recent transactions.
</p>
<p class="welcome">
  Only you can see your transactions, thanks to your user account. The only time anyone else can see your transaction information is if you give away your password.
</p>
<p class="welcome">
  Enjoy!
</p>
